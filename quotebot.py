#  To run quotebot, type `python quotebot.py <host> <channel (no #)> [--ssl|--plain] <nick> [--readconfig]` into a terminal, replacing the placeholders with your configuration.

# The `--readconfig` flag reads all other data from the file titled `config.json` in the same directory as quotebot. This installation should contain an example configuration file, titled `config_example.json`.
# The `--password` flag prompts the user for a password when starting quotebot. Note that you may not be able to see the password as you type it, and that this can interfere with running quotebot in a location where you cannot actively input text. Does not run with `--readconfig`, as it does not apply there; the `config.json` file has an option for a password.
